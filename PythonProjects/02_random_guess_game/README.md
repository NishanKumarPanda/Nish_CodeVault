# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple and fun console-based Python game where the computer generates a random number and the player tries to guess it.  
The game gives hints after each guess — whether the target number is **higher** or **lower** than the player's guess.

---

## 📜 How It Works
1. The program randomly selects a number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess:
   - If the guess is **too high**, the game says: `"Lower number please"`.
   - If the guess is **too low**, the game says: `"Higher number please"`.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
5. Displays the total number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
